My name is Ranbir Mittal, I am a high school student and a certified yoga instructor. Yoga is a passion for me that I use to help other students like me who need it in their daily lives. I have been practicing yoga for a few years, but decided to take the plunge to become a certified teacher, so that I could share my knowledge and benefits with the community.
